## Data Wrangling with Python

Welcome to the code repository for Data Wrangling with Python! We hope you find the code and data here useful. If you have any questions reach out to @kjam or @JackieKazil on Twitter or GitHub.

### Code Structure

We've kept all of the code samples in folders separated by chapter and the data in a similar fashion. You'll likely want to 'undo' this work. It will be far more useful for you to have the data all in one folder that you can easily import and use. Remember, storing data in a repository is usually not a good idea.

### Code Examples

We have not included every code sample you've found in the book, but we have included a majority of the finished scripts. Although these are included, we encourage you to write out each code sample on your own and use these only as a reference.

### Questions?
